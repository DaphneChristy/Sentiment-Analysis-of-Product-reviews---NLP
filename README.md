#  Sentiment Analysis of Product Reviews using NLP

##  Overview
This project focuses on **analyzing product reviews** using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning** to classify them as **Positive**, **Neutral**, or **Negative**.  
It provides valuable insights into customer satisfaction and helps businesses make data-driven improvements.

---

##  Technology Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Frameworks / Libraries:** NLTK, scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, TensorFlow (optional)  
- **Techniques:** Text Preprocessing, Tokenization, TF-IDF, Machine Learning (Naive Bayes)  

---

##  Objective
To build a sentiment analysis system that automatically identifies customer opinions and emotions from product reviews, empowering organizations to **analyze feedback**, **track satisfaction**, and **enhance their offerings**.

---

##  Features
- Classifies reviews into **Positive**, **Neutral**, or **Negative**  
- Preprocesses text: lowercasing, punctuation removal, stopword filtering  
- Uses **TF-IDF vectorization** for numerical text representation  
- Employs **Naive Bayes classifier** for accurate sentiment prediction  
- Generates clear results and accuracy reports

##  How It Works
1. **Data Preprocessing:** Cleans and normalizes raw text (punctuation removal, tokenization).  
2. **Feature Extraction:** Converts text into numerical features using TF-IDF.  
3. **Model Training:** Trains a Naive Bayes model on labeled data.  
4. **Prediction:** Predicts sentiment for new or unseen reviews.
